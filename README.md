This project contains notebooks that provides a comprehensive introduction to various deep learning techniques,
from basic neural networks to advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and their applications in real-world problems

These notebooks are created as assignments while I am taking a course on Coursera
* [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/home/welcome)

Skills -> Computer Vision, Image Classification, Deep Neural Network, Convolution, Pooling, Activation, Optimizer, Loss function, Tensorflow, Keras, Python

Included Notebooks:
- https://github.com/TechWithRamaa/Deep-Learning-in-Tensorflow/blob/main/SLNN-House-Prices-Prediction.ipynb
   - This model predicts house prices based on the number of bedrooms using linear regression
- https://github.com/TechWithRamaa/Deep-Learning-in-Tensorflow/blob/main/Neural-Network-Image-Classification.ipynb
   - This model trains a neural network to classify Fashion MNIST into 10 categories using a feedforward architecture with one hidden layer
- https://github.com/TechWithRamaa/Deep-Learning-in-Tensorflow/blob/main/Speeding-Neural-Network-With-Convolution.ipynb
   - This CNN model effectively leverages convolutional and pooling layers for building efficient, scalable, and robust neural networks for multi-classifaction of huge image dataset
- https://github.com/TechWithRamaa/Deep-Learning-in-Tensorflow/blob/main/CNN-Happy-Sad-Image-Classification.ipynb
   - This model features a CNN for binary image classification (happy/sad) with three convolutional layers, ReLU activation, and max pooling,
     followed by a dense layer and sigmoid output. It uses the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, with early stopping based on accuracy.
